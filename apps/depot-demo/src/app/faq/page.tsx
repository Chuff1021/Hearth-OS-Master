    questions: [
      {
        q: "What areas do you serve?",
        a: "We serve Tilton, Illinois and the surrounding areas including Illiana, Nixa, Ozark, Battlefield, and communities within a 50-mile radius of our showroom.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do you offer financing?",
        a: "Yes! We offer flexible financing options to help make your fireplace purchase more affordable. Contact us for current rates and terms.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I see the fireplaces in action before buying?",
        a: "Absolutely! Our showroom has many working displays so you can see how different models look and operate. Visit us during business hours to explore our selection.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Installation",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Do you provide installation services?",
        a: "Yes, we have certified technicians who handle all installations. Professional installation is included with most fireplace purchases to ensure safety and proper operation.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long does installation typically take?",
        a: "Installation time varies by project. A simple insert installation may take 4-6 hours, while a new fireplace with venting could take 1-2 days. We'll provide a timeline during your consultation.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need a chimney for a gas fireplace?",
        a: "Not necessarily. Many gas fireplaces can be vented directly through an exterior wall using direct vent technology. We can evaluate your home and recommend the best options.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can you install a fireplace in a home without an existing chimney?",
        a: "Yes! We offer vent-free and direct vent options that don't require a traditional chimney. Electric fireplaces are another great option that require no venting at all.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Maintenance & Service",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "How often should I have my fireplace serviced?",
        a: "We recommend annual service for all fireplaces. Gas fireplaces should be inspected and cleaned yearly, while wood-burning fireplaces and stoves may need more frequent chimney cleaning depending on use.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do you offer maintenance plans?",
        a: "Yes, we offer annual maintenance plans that include inspection, cleaning, and priority service scheduling. Ask about our service agreements for peace of mind.",
      },
      {
        q: "What are signs my fireplace needs service?",
        a: "Look for: unusual odors, difficulty starting, pilot light issues, soot buildup, strange sounds, or reduced heat output. If you notice any of these, contact us for an inspection.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Products",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What's the difference between a fireplace and an insert?",
        a: "A fireplace is a complete unit that can be installed in new construction or added to a home. An insert is designed to fit inside an existing masonry fireplace opening to improve efficiency and update the look.",
      },
      {
        q: "Which is more efficient: gas, wood, or pellet?",
        a: "Gas fireplaces are typically the most efficient (70-85% efficiency) with the convenience of instant on/off. Pellet stoves offer excellent efficiency (70-83%) with automated feeding. Wood provides the classic ambiance but lower efficiency (50-70%). The best choice depends on your needs and preferences.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I convert my wood fireplace to gas?",
        a: "In most cases, yes! Gas inserts are specifically designed for this purpose. We can assess your existing fireplace and recommend the best conversion options.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do electric fireplaces provide real heat?",
        a: "Yes, electric fireplaces can produce 4,000-5,000 BTUs of heat, enough to warm a 400-500 sq ft room. They're an excellent option for zones without gas lines or where venting isn't possible.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Orders & Shipping",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Do you ship products?",
        a: "We offer local delivery within our service area. For customers outside our region, contact us to discuss shipping options for smaller items like parts and accessories.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is your return policy?",
        a: "Unused, uninstalled products may be returned within 30 days with original packaging and receipt. A restocking fee may apply. Custom orders and installed items are non-returnable. See our full policy for details.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I track my order?",
